# Types

In PopDyLan.jl, important data structures are given their own types. Thus, there is a type for a speaker, a type for a speech community, a type for a grammar, etc. These are referenced below, categorized into *linguistic types* (types for grammars, parameter settings, and the like), *individual types* (types for representing individual speakers) and *population types* (types for speech communities).
